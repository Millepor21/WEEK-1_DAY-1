# WEEK-1_DAY-1
this is code that we worked on in the morning session of coding temple's full stack coding cohort starting on the 14th of August with week zero and week one this morning.
We learned of some advised extensions to use as well as how to use boilerplate and the importance
of using specific containers rather than all multi purpose containers.
